### Email 2: Success Story + Implementation Tip (Day 3)
**Subject:** How Dr. Martinez Cut Her Billing Time From 3 Hours to 20 Minutes
**Send:** 3 days after signup

```
Hi [First Name],

I wanted to share a quick success story that might resonate with you.

Dr. Sarah Martinez runs a family practice in Texas. Before AI automation, she was staying until 8 PM every day just to finish billing.

Here's what changed everything for her:

**The Problem:** Manually coding 25-30 patient encounters daily was taking 3+ hours
**The Solution:** She started with just Strategy #1 from your guide - automated ICD-10 extraction
**The Result:** Billing time dropped to 20 minutes. She now leaves the office by 5:30 PM.

**Her #1 tip for getting started:**
"Don't try to automate everything at once. Pick your highest-volume diagnosis codes and start there. I began with diabetes and hypertension visits - that alone saved me 90 minutes a day."

**Want to see how this would work for your practice?**
I'm offering free 15-minute demos where I'll show you the exact process Dr. Martinez used.

üìÖ Book your demo: [Calendly Link]

During the demo, I'll:
‚úÖ Analyze your current billing workflow
‚úÖ Show you live AI code extraction 
‚úÖ Calculate your potential time savings
‚úÖ Give you a custom implementation roadmap

Best,
Dr. Chukwuma Onyeije

P.S. - Dr. Martinez also mentioned the reduced stress was just as valuable as the time savings. When was the last time you left the office feeling caught up on billing?

### Email 3: Common Mistakes + Case Study (Day 7)
**Subject:** The #1 Mistake I See Doctors Make With AI Billing (It's Not What You Think)
**Send:** 7 days after signup

```
Hi [First Name],

After helping 200+ physicians implement AI billing automation, I've noticed the same mistake over and over again.

**The mistake?** Trying to maintain 100% manual review of every AI suggestion.

I get it - you want to ensure accuracy. But here's what happens:

‚ùå You spend just as much time "reviewing" as you did manually coding
‚ùå You don't trust the AI, so you double-check everything anyway  
‚ùå You miss out on 80% of the time savings

**The better approach:**
Start by fully automating your highest-confidence, highest-volume codes.

For example:
- Type 2 Diabetes routine visits ‚Üí E11.9 (AI accuracy: 98%+)
- Hypertension check-ups ‚Üí I10 (AI accuracy: 99%+)
- Annual wellness visits ‚Üí Z00.00 (AI accuracy: 97%+)

**Real example:** Dr. Kim Park in Seattle identified 15 code patterns that represented 70% of her visits. She set these to auto-approve. Result? Her billing time went from 2.5 hours to 35 minutes daily.

**Want to identify your highest-impact automation opportunities?**
I'll do this analysis for free during a 15-minute demo.

üìÖ Book here: [Calendly Link]

I'll review your most common diagnosis patterns and show you exactly which codes to automate first for maximum impact.

Best,
Dr. Chukwuma Onyeije

P.S. - What percentage of your visits fall into routine, predictable categories? Most physicians are surprised to discover it's 60-80%. That's your automation goldmine!

### Email 4: ROI Calculator + Urgency (Day 10)
**Subject:** Is AI Billing Worth the Investment? (30-Second ROI Check)
**Send:** 10 days after signup

```
Hi [First Name],

Let's do some quick math on AI billing automation ROI:

**Your Current State (estimate for 10-physician practice):**
- Billing hours per week: 40 hours
- Average cost per hour: $25 
- Weekly cost: $1,000
- Annual cost: $52,000

**With 80% AI Automation:**
- Billing hours per week: 8 hours
- Weekly cost: $200
- Annual cost: $10,400
- **Annual savings: $41,600**

**Plus hidden benefits:**
- Faster claim processing: +$15,000 improved cash flow
- Reduced errors/denials: +$10,000 prevented losses
- **Total first-year impact: $66,600**

**For CodeCraftMD:** Starting at $197/month = $2,364/year
**Net ROI:** $64,236 (2,715% return)

**But here's the thing I don't talk about in marketing materials...**

The real value isn't just money - it's getting your evenings back. It's not staying late to finish billing. It's reducing the administrative burden that's burning out so many good physicians.

**Ready to see your specific ROI?**
During our demo, I'll run these numbers for your exact practice size and workflow.

I only have a few demo slots left this month, and I want to make sure you get the chance to see this in action.

Best,
Dr. Chukwuma Onyeije

P.S. - What would you do with an extra 6-8 hours per week? Spend more time with patients? Actually take a lunch break? Get home in time for dinner? That's what this is really about.

### Email 5: Final Call + Alternative Resources (Day 14)
**Subject:** Last chance for your free demo (+ 3 ways to implement AI billing on your own)
**Send:** 14 days after signup

```
Hi [First Name],

This is my last follow-up about the free CodeCraftMD demo.

I know you're busy, and maybe automated AI billing isn't a priority right now. I totally get it - we all have full plates.

**But before I stop emailing you about this, let me share 3 ways you can start implementing AI billing automation on your own:**

**Option 1: DIY with OpenAI API**
- Set up a ChatGPT API account
- Create prompts for ICD-10 extraction
- Build basic automation workflows
- Estimated setup time: 20-30 hours
- Monthly cost: $50-200 depending on volume

**Option 2: Existing EHR Add-ons**
- Check if your EHR has AI coding features
- Epic, Cerner, and Athena all have some automation
- Usually requires additional licensing
- Setup through your EHR vendor

**Option 3: Free/Manual Implementation**
- Use the strategies from your PDF guide
- Create templates for common visit types  
- Build coding shortcuts and macros
- Standardize your documentation patterns

**Or... if you want to see a purpose-built solution in action:**
üìÖ Book your demo here: [Calendly Link]

**Either way, I'm rooting for you to get some of your time back.**

If you implement any of these approaches, hit reply and let me know how it goes. I love hearing success stories, even when they don't involve CodeCraftMD!

Best,
Dr. Chukwuma Onyeije
