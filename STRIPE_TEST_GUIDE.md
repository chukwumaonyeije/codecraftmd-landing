## 🐛 If Payment Fails

### Check Browser Console
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for error messages
4. Check if any requests are failing

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"Payment processing failed"**
- Check if webhook secret is set correctly
- Verify Stripe keys are live keys, not test keys

**"Authentication error"**
- Make sure you're logged in to Firebase Auth
- Check if user session is valid

**"Function not found"**
- Functions might still be deploying
- Wait 2-3 minutes and try again

### Debug Steps
1. **Check Function Logs:**
   ```powershell
   firebase functions:log --limit 50
   ```

2. **Check Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments
   - Look for payment attempts
   - Check for webhook delivery issues

3. **Test Customer Creation:**
   - First payment should create a Stripe customer
   - Check Stripe Dashboard → Customers for new entry

## 🎯 Expected Flow

   - Creates Stripe customer automatically
   - Stores customer ID in Firebase
   - Gets 5 free credits initially

2. **Payment Processing:**
   - Creates payment intent with customer
   - Processes payment through Stripe
   - Updates credits in Firebase via webhook

3. **Success:**
