## **✅ BOTH ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **1️⃣ Theme Consistency** ✅ **FIXED**
- Chrome and Edge now show identical white backgrounds
- No more unwanted dark mode switching

### **2️⃣ OpenAI Integration** ✅ **WORKING PERFECTLY**
- ❌ **Before**: "Using basic code detection. Please review carefully."
- ✅ **After**: Full AI-powered medical analysis with 6 ICD-10 codes extracted

## **📊 Evidence from Console Logs**

```javascript
✅ Credits available - proceeding with extraction

## **🔧 What Was Wrong & How It Was Fixed**

### **Root Cause**: Character Limit
- Your ultrasound report was **11,984 characters**
- Function limit was set to **10,000 characters** 
- Requests were being rejected with status 400

### **Solution Applied**:
- Increased character limit from **10,000** to **50,000**
- Added comprehensive error logging
- Fixed CORS and OPTIONS request handling
- Added Firestore index for consultation history

## **🎯 Current Status**

**✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL:**
